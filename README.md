Purdue University Dynamic Parking Map

This is a personal project designed to help me learn more about geospatial data, Leaflet.js, and working with GeoJSON and ArcGIS Feature Layers.
While the application displays real data from Purdue University, it is not affiliated with or maintained by Purdue University.

🚗 Overview

This web application provides a dynamic, interactive parking map of the Purdue University campus. Users can view the locations of parking lots and campus buildings, filter parking types, and access directions.

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience working with geospatial datasets, spatial queries, and mapping tools in a real-world context.

📍 Data Sources

All building and parking location data is sourced from publicly available datasets hosted by Purdue University's [ArcGIS Online portal](https://purdueuniversity.maps.arcgis.com):
