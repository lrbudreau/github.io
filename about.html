    <h2>About the Purdue University Dynamic Parking Map</h2>
  
    <p><strong>Purdue University Dynamic Parking Map</strong> is a personal project developed to explore and learn more about geospatial data, interactive web mapping, and GIS tools like Leaflet.js, GeoJSON, and ArcGIS Feature Layers.</p>
  
    <p>This interactive web application displays real-time data from Purdue University's ArcGIS Online portal, offering users a dynamic view of campus parking lots and buildings. While the data is sourced from Purdue, this application is not affiliated with or maintained by the university.</p>
  
    <h3>🚗 Project Overview</h3>
    <p>The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience working with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Live geospatial datasets</li>
      <li>Spatial queries and filters</li>
      <li>Web mapping tools and libraries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Users can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>View real-time parking lot and campus building data</li>
      <li>Filter parking types by category</li>
      <li>Access directions and explore campus layout interactively</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>📍 Data Sources</h3>
    <p>All geospatial data is publicly available and accessed directly from Purdue University’s ArcGIS Online portal:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=XXXXXX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Purdue Campus Buildings</a> <em>(Feature Layer)</em></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=XXXXXX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parking 2020 – Lots & Garages</a> <em>(Feature Layer)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      These datasets are integrated live using Esri’s FeatureService endpoints.
    </blockquote>
  
    <h3>🔧 Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Leaflet.js</strong> – For creating interactive maps</li>
      <li><strong>Esri Leaflet</strong> – For integrating ArcGIS Feature Layers</li>
      <li><strong>HTML / CSS / JavaScript</strong> – Core frontend development</li>
      <li><strong>GeoJSON & ArcGIS REST Services</strong> – For handling spatial data</li>
    </ul>
